This project produces a matlab "mex" file which allows you to access MOOS
communications from within matlab. 

Building iMatlab
-------------------
From release 10.0.1 onwards CMake is *not* used to build the project. 
It was becoming tricky to support multiple versions of matlab on multiple
platforms and effort was being expended duplicating matlabs own ability
to generate mex files.

So to build the project simply 

 a) from with matlab "cd" to the source directory of this project.
 b) run the build script make_imatlab.m by typing "make_imatlab" at the command line within matlab
 c) follow the instructions provided to you.


Problems pointing "mex" at the correct installation
---------------------------------------------------

If you are unsure about which source tree to point the install script at
(you are asked to do this during the build) you might find the CMake
script  in the "build_help" directory useful. 

Running "cmake ./" from the "build_help" directory will print out
include directories for any compatible MOOS builds found on your system.
This requires MOOS release 10.0.1 or higher.
