\begin{abstract}
AppCasting is a means for an application to regularly generate a
single common data structure containing a rich status report,
configuration and run-time alerts, and significant events. These
reports are in addition to whatever else the application may otherwise
publish to the MOOSDB. They are designed primary with debugging and
alert generation in mind. They are also designed to work in an
on-demand fashion so as to minimize CPU load, comms traffic, and log
file size. This document describes (a) the motivation and design
considerations behind appcasting, (b) tools for viewing appcasts, (c)
how to develop new, or convert existing MOOS applications to be
appcast-enabled, and (d) how the appcasting protocol is implemented
under the hood to ensure on-demand behavior.
