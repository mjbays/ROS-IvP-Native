Prior to build the code in this directory you should have built
the MOOS code by executing the build-moos.sh script in the 
top-level moos-ivp directory. This should only need to be done
once upon checkout or in the rarer case that the MOOS tree
is updated. 

The code in this directory is meant to be built with the following
steps:

> cmake ./
> make

On subsequent builds, needed as a result of your edits of exiting
source code, just typing "make" should suffice. If however new source
code has been added or deleted, or if any of the CMakeLists.txt files
have been edited, then executing both steps may be necessary.

The build process depends on some third party software being installed
on your system. Some may have been installed during your linux install
as a default selection. Others may need to be installed by you (or
your system administrator) before proceeding.

The dependencies are :

App Name    Package name       Dependent Apps
--------    ----------------   -----------------
g++         g++                all
cmake       cmake              all
make        make               all
libtiff     libtiff4-dev       (1,3,4,5,6)
OpenGL      libgl1-mesa-dev    (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)

(1) lib_marineview
(2) lib_ipfview
(3) pMarineViewer
(4) pShipsideViewer
(5) app_geoview
(6) app_logview
(7) app_ffview

On Debian systems, these packages can be installed with the following
four lines (as the root or superuser):

> apt-get install cmake
> apt-get install make
> apt-get install libtiff4
> apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev

If you are unable to install a requisite package, you can disable the
build of the dependent app by editing src/CMakeLists.txt and simply
commenting out the line for the dependent app.
