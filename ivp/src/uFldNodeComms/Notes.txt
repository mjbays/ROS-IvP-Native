Incoming: NODE_REPORT or NODE_REPORT_LOCAL

Outgoing: NODE_REPORT_ALPHA, 
          NODE_REPORT_BRAVO 

Note: In the above, NODE_REPORT_ALPHA for example, these constitute
node reports TO BE BRIDGED to Alpha, not the Alpha node reports


o When a new vehicle has been noted, a new bridge entry is to 
  be set up with a posting to pMOOSBridge

  PMB_REGISTER = NODE_REPORT_ALPHA -> alpha @ IP, port -> NODE_REPORT

o The uFldNodeComms when it receives a NODE_REPORT, it may make postings
  to all NODE_REPORT_FOOBAR varialbes where FOOBAR is any vehicle that 
  didn't originate the report.  

  uFldNodeComms can decide which vehicles are to get the reports based
  on the ranges between vehicles.

  uFldNodeComms could even add noise to the node reports
